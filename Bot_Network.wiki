* Purpose: The purpose of this server is to handle all bot trading. Create a high level api to interact with and everything else will be handled by the server. All in between transactions.
* Thoughts: Use nodejs server as bot network. URI resource for giving commands of sending trade to another user. 
* Functionality: 
  * Input: Other User, Items, Deposit or Withdraw.
  * Output: Trade request from main bot to user with items requested. 
  * Callbacks: Web_Server needs callbacks to update information. Is the item in siteInventory? Actioncable to automatically update user's site.
  * Wanted Features: 
    1. Fast offers (definitely under 10 seconds, 5 perferable)
    2. Limit of 15 items for max trade 
    3. Sort items per bot
    4. Automatically create the sorting per bot from items found in mongodb
    5. Config for changing how many bots there are 
  * Potential Problems:
    1. Could take to long to send offer
    2. Try sending offer when not all items are in the main bot 
* Notes
  * How to synchronize all trades so that all the items are in the main bot before sending the final offer to the user.
    * Use async await for sending items to main bot. Wait for all items to be accepted, then have main bot send offer to user.  
  * How to get callback once main bot accepts items. 
    * Start bots and use the bots as arguments for each worker. While processing send out requests for slave bots. Wait until they're done then wait until the main bot accepts. 
    * Have to create middle ware to connect the event in the bot to the promise that is waiting for the answers. Function that gets the trade offer ids and.
